# Quantum-Tunnelling-Simulation
This was my course project in Advanced Simulation Technique in Physics (EP 438) at IIT Bombay.

Go through report for understnding the physics. "ajp.pdf" is the main reseaerch paper my group (me, Soham Mukhopadhyay and Anand Kumar) worked on.

All simulaions are in a infinte potential well. Inside the well, potential of any kind can be given. The speed of the animation can also be altered.

"gaussian.py" runs simulation on gaussian wave packets. "step.py" runs simulation on plane wave only.
